Predictional of hostpitalization & medical costs based on their past health conditions , age , habits(smoking) , body mass index and past charges.

The problem statement of my project is predicting the hospitalization and medical costs by using the past health conditions, age , habits(smoker) and past peopleâ€™s charges with similar health conditions.

The data consists of age,gender,body mass index,smoking,children they have and charges.

So in this project I am analyzing the given data with plotting graphs.

after analyzing by using Machine learning building model.

By splitting the dataset as 70 percent of data set for training model and  30 percent for testing the model.

Agenda

The main agenda of this project is to analyze the dataset which contains the data of past charges for hospitalization and medical costs with the pariticular age and their habits.

By using Machine learning algorithms building the model and predicting model and analyzing the performance using performance metrics.

Process

Load the data set.
Convert the categorical data into numerical data.

 Imputting the missing values in to the dataset.
 
Splitting the dataset for training and testing data.

building the model using differnt Machine Learning Algorithms.

Caluculaing the Performance Measures.

Technology and Tools.

IDE  : Jupyter Notebook

Programming language :  Python (for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling).

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization).

Algorithms


Linear Regression.

Ridge Regression.

Support Vector Machine.

Outcomes

A predictive model capable of estimating medical costs for individuals with a reasonable level of accuracy.

Insights into the most significant factors influencing medical costs.

Visualizations and reports to effectively communicate findings and recommendations.

Solution and it's Prepositions


This helps the End users for easily analysing thier costs before stepping into the Hospital.
